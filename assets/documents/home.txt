I need to recreate a generic financial product company home page modeled after this screenshot. I would like to include this type of information and layout.

This page would fall into the content space of the view structure.

IMPORTANT.
The final output can not mention Fidelity at all. In no content or imagery should there be and reference to this company. Use the term Product Company if needed.
Do not use the example image green color. Use the same blue that you have in the Product Company name in the Enhanced NLP Input component.
