I need to create a smart suggestion panel which will react to our canned prototype search scenarios. The panel will have a default state for display before entry begins and then once focus shifts to the input the suggestion panel will indicate our 3 zones of content type; Answer, Wayfinding, Conversation.

Default view
The default view will have 3 cards in one row as shown in the visual.

Search scenarios
As indicated in the search view requirements, there will be three search paths based on intent type. Each path has a Short, Medium, Long input string. 

Symbol
Short: aapl
Medium: aapl dividends
Long: aapl dividends received for 2024 and 2025

Term
Short: RMD
Medium: RMD schedule
Long: RMD scheduled payments next year

Question
Short: How do I
Medium: How do I open
Long: How do I open a brokerage account


3 content zones
There are 3 zones for Answer, Wayfinding, Conversation and there are logic rules for how these display based on both the intent type path and the input length.

Answer: Show content block with definition of what is an RMD
A Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) is the annual amount you must withdraw from your retirement accounts, such as traditional IRAs and employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s, once you reach a specific age, typically 73. The RMD ensures that you don't let your retirement savings grow indefinitely tax-free, and instead, you start receiving distributions while you're alive.

Answer: Show content block with a different definition of what is the schedule
For the 2024 tax year, Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for retirement accounts generally start at age 73. The first RMD for the 2024 tax year must be taken by April 1, 2025, and the second RMD by December 31, 2025. While the RMD age is 73 for those who reached age 72 after December 31, 2022, and age 73 before January 1, 2033, it will gradually increase to 75 for those who reach age 74 after December 31, 2032.

Answer: Show content block with different definition for next year
For 2025, if you reached age 73 in 2024, you must take your first Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) by April 1, 2025, and your second RMD by December 31, 2025. All subsequent RMDs are due by December 31 of each year. First RMD Deadline: The SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 raised the RMD age to 73, effective January 1, 2023. If you reached age 73 in 2024, your first RMD is due by April 1, 2025. Subsequent RMDs: All subsequent RMDs must be taken by December 31 of each year.
