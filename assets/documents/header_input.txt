I need to create a component with two elements, one which is a icon button which looks like a traditional search input and another that is an icon button. Each work differently, and independently.

Search button
When the user clicks the element, the system will open a panel which we call SmartSuggest panel. This panel will be positioned at the bottom of the Full_header and expand full width.

Research button
When the user clicks the element, the system will open the Research view in the main Content area.

Visuals
The attached images are a representation of the overall look of the component.

The pink labels are for identification and would not be part of the coded component. The pink arrows and supporting text would not be part of the coded component.

Icons
For the search button, use your stock magnify icon
For the research button, please ask me for the sparkle image
