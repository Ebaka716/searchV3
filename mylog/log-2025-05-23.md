## Customer Service Template Scroll Anchor Bug & Fix

### Problem
- When loading customer service (CS) templates in the dialogue area, the scroll position was incorrect: the template header and preamble were scrolled too high, often hidden behind the fixed main page header.
- This issue did **not** occur with AAPL templates, which always scrolled the header into perfect view below the fixed header.
- The bug made the CS template experience inconsistent and confusing for users, as the main content was not visible after navigation or query.

### Root Cause
- In `DialogueArea.tsx`, AAPL templates were passed a `headerRef` prop (used for scroll anchoring), but customer service templates were **not**.
- The scroll logic relies on this `headerRef` to anchor the scroll position to the template's main header.
- Without the ref, the scroll logic could not correctly position the CS template header, causing it to be hidden or misaligned.

### What We Did to Fix It
1. **Code Review:**
   - Compared the rendering logic for AAPL and CS templates in `DialogueArea.tsx`.
   - Noticed that only AAPL templates received the `headerRef` prop, while CS templates did not.
2. **Prop Alignment:**
   - Updated the rendering of all customer service templates to pass `headerRef={...}` exactly as is done for AAPL templates.
   - This ensures the scroll anchor is set on the main template header for both template types.
3. **Tested Behavior:**
   - Verified that after the fix, both AAPL and CS templates scroll the header and preamble into perfect view, just below the fixed main page header.
   - The user experience is now consistent and robust for all template types.

### Best Practice Going Forward
- **Always ensure that any template component intended to be scroll-anchored receives the correct `headerRef` prop from the dialogue area.**
- When adding new template types, double-check that all props related to scroll, focus, or navigation are handled identically to existing, working templates.

**Result:**  
The scroll anchoring issue is resolved, and the user experience is now consistent and robust for all template types.
