# System Patterns

_This document describes the system architecture, key technical decisions, and design patterns in use._

- Modular component/page structure (Header, Content, Sidebars)
- Variant toggling via context/provider and menu
- Array-driven logic for search/research templates
- Each major variant is its own file (no hard forks)
- Clean PR workflow, collaborative dev
